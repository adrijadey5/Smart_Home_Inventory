HOMESTOCK-A SMART HOME INVENTORY SYSTEM

This application simplifies household inventory management with a modern, user-friendly interface along with user authentication and smart features. Users can quickly add items from predefined lists or custom entries, use quick-add buttons for frequent quantities, simulate barcode/QR code scanning, and track recurring items. The system automatically highlights low-stock or near-expiry items in a summary dashboard, reducing manual effort and making inventory management fast, efficient, and semi-automated. The inventory items log history and user login detail reside in database.

Key Features:
Item Management: Add, edit, or delete items in the inventory with details such as name, quantity, category, and expiry date.
Quick Add / Templates: Predefined common household items for fast addition, reducing manual typing.
Barcode Simulation: Simulate scanning items for automatic addition to inventory (optional module for future enhancement).
Expiration Alerts: Visual cues or notifications for items nearing their expiry dates.
Search & Filter: Quickly find items by name, category, or expiry status.
Responsive UI: Works across devices, ensuring access from desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Backend Integration: Connects with a database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) via API to store and retrieve inventory data securely.
Cloud Deployment: Hosted on Firebase or Vercel for easy access anywhere.
